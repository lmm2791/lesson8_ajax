### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned about JSON and how it facilitates data transmission between an app and the webserver. JSON format is in common usage across the web. It might be a reasch to call it a standard (the web is evolving so quickly!) but it's one of the biggies. 
2. AJAX allows data to load without refreshing the browser. This allows for increased speed and interactivity. It accomplishes this with the same building blocks that all dynamic websites have: XHTML, CSS, Javascript and the DOM. 
3. Publicly releasing their API is how the big players of the web enable their content to be easily incorporated into other websites. It also helps to avoid reinventing the wheel by allowing other apps to incorporate 3rd party data.
